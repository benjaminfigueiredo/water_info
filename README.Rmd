The goal of waterinfo is to provide information about water density at ambient temperature

## Installation

You can install the development version of waterinfo like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("benjaminfigueiredo/foo")
```

## Example

Suppose you want to know the density of water at room temperature in kg/L. You can run the snippet

```{r example}
library(waterinfo)
ambient_T <- 293 # Kelvin
rho <- water_density_at_ambient_temperature(ambient_T) # in kg/L
```
